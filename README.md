# Summarizer API

Summarizer is a Go-based web API that scrapes content from URLs and utilizes OpenAI's GPT model to provide summaries of the scraped documents. The application supports interaction through a streaming endpoint using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## Features

- Scrape content from Wikipedia and generic web pages.
- Stream real-time summaries generated by the OpenAI API.
- Display formatted summaries organized with headers.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.23 or later
- An OpenAI API key (set in the environment variable OPENAI_API_KEY)
- Colly for web scraping

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/alexleyoung/summarizer.git`
`cd summarizer`

2. Install dependencies:

Ensure you have the required Go modules by running:

`go mod tidy`

3. Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

`OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here`

## Running the Application

To run the server, execute the following command:

`go run main.go`

The server will start on http://localhost:8080.

## Usage

Send a request to scrape a URL:

Open your web browser or use a tool like curl or Postman to scrape a page:

`curl http://localhost:8080/<URL>`

Replace <URL> with the URL you want to summarize. For example:

`curl http://localhost:8080/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golang`

The server will respond with a stream of summarized content that can be displayed using client-side JavaScript.
